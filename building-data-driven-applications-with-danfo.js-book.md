## What this book is about

The book then shows you how to load different datasets, combine and analyze them by performing operations such as handling missing values and string manipulations. You'll also get to grips with data plotting, visualization, aggregation, and group operations by combining Danfo.js with Plotly. As you advance, you'll create a no-code data analysis and handling system and create-react-app, react-table, react-chart, Draggable.js, and tailwind, and understand how to use TensorFlow.js and Danfo.js to build a recommendation system. Finally, you'll build a Twitter analytics dashboard powered by Danfo.js, Next.js, node-nlp, and Twit.js.

By the end of this app development book, you'll be able to build and embed data analytics, visualization, and ML capabilities into any JavaScript app in server-side Node.js or the browser.
